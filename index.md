### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 is a favorite because it's what starts off with us starting to program doing something simple. It first shows bits of programming which shows how entirely different it is compared to other programs like Java on how to write words in code which shows how more challenging it is while also taking note of those codes too. It also shows more about using a terminal which I found interesting using it as a text box to use commands to access files, test codes, and finalize programs and git push to send to github which I found interesting and cool to use while learning to do more in programming in other labs.

* Lab 8

    Part 8, Part 1 is also a favorite because it uses if and for loops in the program for Olympic Judge Average. It showed me more complex coding to calculate minimum and maximum scores then sort of adds up to the average to the olympic average. It's one of the labs I utilize in cooperating with my partner which led to finishing the lab on time.

* Lab 10

    Part 10, part 1 is another favorite of mine that utilizes a program to tell if counties in California have a certain amount of percentage representing the amount overall in the population of California. I also found it interesting that there was already build code within to show data for a county and its population showing how much you would have needed to type if starting from scratch shows how much work is put into making a program. Utilizing for loops and const taught me more to adding and valuing it in order to get taught me more to coding and making full on programs.
